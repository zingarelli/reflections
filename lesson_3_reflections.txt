When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Reply: When I want to share my code so others can see it and download it to their own
repository. It's also good to have a remote repository when working together with other 
people as a team, so everybody can work on the same project and eventually update their 
changes to the remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Reply: Maybe if you're working with other people, it might be better if you pull changes 
so you may know what went on between the time you last pulled from the remote repository.
