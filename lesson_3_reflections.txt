When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Reply: When I want to share my code so others can see it and download it to their own
repository. It's also good to have a remote repository when working together with other 
people as a team, so everybody can work on the same project and eventually update their 
changes to the remote repository.
