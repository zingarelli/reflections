What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Reply: When I initialize a repository, a hidden directory is created, .git/
which contains metadata regarding this repository. This is needed so Git
can track the files contained in that repository, commits and changes 
that've been made in that repository. It contains all kinds of information
needed for the version control of a project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?
Reply: The staging area works as an intermediary step between a directory
and a repository. Files in the staging are ready to commit, which in turn
add them to the repository. This intermediary offers flexibilization of
which files the user wants to add to the repository and which files should
be only in the working directory.
